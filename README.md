# Adafruit Feather + Charlie Wing

## Purpose

I cobbled this together with no particular usage in mind and then I realized I could use it for
just about anything!

First I rigged it up to IFTTT so that if my daughter texted me a number it would light up that many rows of lights. That got boring pretty fast.

Then I realized I could query Zendesk to see how many unsolved tickets were assigned to me and display that on the board! I know. Kinda weird.

## Usage

To get this working for yourself just rename config-example.h and fill in the missing values for your Adafruit I/O credentials and your Wifi.
